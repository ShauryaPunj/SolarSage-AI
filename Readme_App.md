# Solar Sage AI (Desktop)

**Solar Sage AI** is a fully local desktop application that helps you quickly check the cleanliness of solar panels using **AI image classification**.  

The app uses:
- **Backend**: FastAPI serving a ResNet18 ONNX model (CLEAN vs DIRTY)
- **Frontend**: Electron desktop interface (webcam capture + uploads + batch + results + analytics)

Runs entirely offline â€” no cloud required.

## âœ¨ Features

### ðŸ”´ Live Camera Mode
- Accesses your Macâ€™s webcam.
- Click **Capture** to take a photo.
- The app sends the image to the FastAPI backend â†’ AI model predicts **CLEAN** or **DIRTY**.
- Instant feedback with probability score.

### ðŸ“‚ Upload Mode
- Upload a single image file (JPEG/PNG).
- See the prediction result with label + probability.
- Great for testing sample solar panel images.

### ðŸ“¦ Batch Mode
- Select an entire folder of images.
- Each image is processed automatically by the model.
- Results displayed in a table (filename + prediction + probability).
- **Download CSV** button exports results to a `.csv` file for record-keeping.

### ðŸ“Š Results Tab
- Shows your session history (all predictions youâ€™ve made since launch).
- Includes predictions from Live, Upload, and Batch.
- Export session results as CSV for documentation.

### ðŸ“ˆ Analytics Tab
- Aggregates your session:
  - Total images processed
  - % CLEAN vs DIRTY
  - Bar chart of class distribution
- Useful for quick insights after scanning a batch.

### âš¡ FastAPI Backend
- Runs locally on port `8000`.
- Exposes these endpoints:
  - `GET /health` â†’ `{"status":"ok","model":"v1.0","backend":"model"}`
  - `POST /predict-image` â†’ classify a single uploaded image
  - `POST /predict-batch` â†’ classify multiple files
  - `GET /model-info` â†’ metadata about the ONNX model

### ðŸ“‘ Documentation & Credits
- **MODEL_CARD.md** â†’ model provenance, metrics, hash
- **AUTHORS.md** â†’ contributors and roles
- **CHANGELOG.md** â†’ version history
- **LICENSE** â†’ legal terms (MIT/Apache)
